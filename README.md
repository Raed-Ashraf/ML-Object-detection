# ML-Object-detection
In this project we are going to learn how to run one of the most popular object detection algorithms YOLOv3.

## What is YOLO?
YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a family of deep learning models designed for fast object Detection.
There are many versions of YOLO, we are using YOLO version 3.
The first version proposed the general architecture, where the second version refined the design and made use of predefined anchor boxes to improve the bounding box proposal, and version three further refined the model architecture and training process.
It is based on the idea that:
" A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. "
